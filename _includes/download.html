                    <p>The lower Congo River (LCR) exhibits extraordinary aquatic biodiversity, endemism, and specialization despite that it comprises less than 2% of the area of the Congo Basin. Unfortunately, our understanding of how the evolutionary processes shape regional patterns of riverine biodiversity in the LCR remains incomplete and thus this has become the focus of my dissertation research.  Conducting scientific research in this river has been historically challenging because of restricted accessibility due to political instability and poor communication throughout the watershed. Thus, my research is made entirely possible because of the large fish collection at the AMNH, particularly from the LCR that was collected over a decade. I extracted DNA from the fish tissues and sequence to obtain genomics data. Then, I used the data to test the theory that is important to understand the processes. Previous studies have suggested that the numerous high-energy rapids that occur throughout the LCR form physical barriers to gene flow, thus facilitating speciation, shaping the diversity of the ichthyofauna. Interestingly, our study results are consistent with the prediction that the rapids are serving as barriers, but they may also act as promoters of gene flow providing occasional dispersal opportunities for riverine fishes. This piece of information is essential because the LCR has been threatened by anthropogenic impacts such as climatic change, hydro-electric dam construction, and overfishing. Our findings suggest that hydrological features are important in maintaining and shaping biodiversity, therefore conserving that aspect of the ecosystem will be crucial. Furthermore, we demonstrated that genomic data obtained from museums can help improve our basic understanding of the evolutionary processes. I learned that there are greater research possibilities using museum collections. Museumsâ€™ potential goes beyond only preserving historical specimens, they contribute to cutting-edge research using DNA to decipher the complicated history of organisms on our planet.</p>
