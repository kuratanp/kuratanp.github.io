                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the American Museum of Natural History and the Graduate Center of City University of New York. I am studying evolutionary processes of cichlid fish in the lower Congo River in Africa by using genomics tools and remote sensing technology. My goal is to provide baseline information helpful to improve conservation strategies of the amazing fish diversity as well as to achieve a sustainable fishery. I was born and raised in Nagano, Japan. </p>
