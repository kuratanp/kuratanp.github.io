                <h2>Parenting</h2>
                <p>I am a mother of two beautiful children. As a woman, when and whether to have a child is a tough decision to make. Iâ€™ve always been career driven and worked very hard to get ahead, but having my own children is something that I have always wanted. Unfortunately, every woman has a biological time limit and eventually has to make the decision. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I believe that the lack of diversity in higher-level positions in science can be attributed to a number of reasons but likely one of the biggest is the balancing of motherhood and career goals. As hectic as an everyday schedule can be to raise two young children, I want to continue my education to achieve my goals. I hope someday someone experiencing similar struggles will be inspired by my path and will remain in science thus continuing to increase diversity and acceptance in science.</p>
